# Rhizome
Rhizome is a track based on a complex adaptive system that can cyclically create and reprocess audio files, which determine a state of the system and which in return are the recorded product of a given state.
The process of copying is the main theme, and in its failure it becomes a creative tool in itself; a copy becomes more or less the original although we may not know the original itself, but rather the multiplication of the original.
In this sense, Deleuze and Guttari speak of the concept of the Rhizome, when within a system constituted by a rooting original, the root itself in its abortive form becomes the new original paradigm itself.

> We don't know yet what the multiple entails when it is no longer attributed, that is, after it has been elevated to the status of a substantive. 
One side of a machinic assemblage faces the strata, which doubtless make it a kind of organism, or signifying totality, or determination attributable to a subject; it also has a side facing a body without organs, which is continually dismantling the organism, causing asignifying particles or pure intensities to pass or circulate, and attributing to itself subjects that it leaves with nothing more than a
name as the trace of an intensity.
